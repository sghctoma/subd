/**
 * @file subd.h
 * @brief Subd is a small set of convenience wrappers around the libdbus API.
 * @author sghctoma
 * @date 15 October 2018
 *
 * Subd is by no means a complete wrapper around libdbus, it just provides some
 * functions that make using the low-level libdbus API more convenient. The
 * scope of subd is very limited currently, it basically provides helpers only
 * in areas I needed to work with:
 *
 *  - Opening a connection to the bus.
 *  - Reading and sending messages.
 *  - Implementing the Introspectable interface.
 *  - Dispatching handlers for method type members.
 *  - Handling watches.
